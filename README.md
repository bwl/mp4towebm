# mp4towebm

Convert all mp4 files in current directory from mp4 to webm

### How to use

You need to specify a bitrate. For great quality, use `8M` as the first argument. For alright quality, use `2M` as the first argument. You can specify whatever you want. The higher the bitrate, the larger the filesize will be.

```bash
mp4towebm 8M
```
